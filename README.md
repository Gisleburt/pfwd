pfwd - Protocol Forward
=======================

An effort to simply copy an incoming TcpStream to an outbound one, and back again.

### The Problem

As a web developer, I often find I need to port forward from one source to another. Port fowarding
is an oddly difficult thing to do, do I thought I'd try to hack together a Rust application to do
the work for me.

Usage
-----

Right now to get even the vaguest amount of use out of this, it must be
manually configured in the source. This will change in the future:

1. Clone
2. Alter source
3. Cargo Run

Contributing
------------

If you'd like to contribute please do! It may be a silly little project but I
will always welcome the work of others. Please make sure you check the Code
Of Conduct, included in the repository, but otherwise, have at!
